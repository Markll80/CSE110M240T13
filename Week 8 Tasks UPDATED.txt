ProfPage/Main Page UI major makeover (Ting, Rye)
1. You guys got rid of the add rating button on profpage, 
   need to add it back through java code to the bottom of the list
2. same thing for search page, "Add New Professor" button should be 
   added through the java code to the end of all the searches
3. Modify the buttons on profPage, change "Like", "Edit", "Report" 
   to text clickables, instead of buttons (for better visual).
   Additionally, consider about having a box containing each 
   comment (wrap each view in a box).
