To do:
Major-
  settings page/ UI
  integrate data from CSE departments into database(if received in time)
  Prof page - Edit function
  read/write ACL when saving objects to database (Eric: should work fine now)
  Title Bar

  testing:
  saving/reading from database with proper cases(upper/lowercases) 
  make sure cases are consistent throughout addProf, addComment etc
  course validation on addComment and addProf.
  
 addRating is breaking - occasionally 
  
Minor - 
  new default picture  (done)
  Wrap comment box
  logo "invisible" background   (done)
  new background page for prof not found? (same as main page now, done)

  Feel free to add additional stuff as needed


Ask Client:
main page - random prof? all prof? top prof(what kind of sorting)?
alphabetical - 10 prof max (Eric: done)


search & search not found page: add prof shouldn't pop up when tying in search box (optional fix if time allows)
button appearance  - new color
found page text Size / not found page text center
no change password

action bar (Cherish) -  (change <- icon to home icon, also - the button crashes the program)

edit with new page (Ting-UI, Eric-Link)
